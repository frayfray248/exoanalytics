# Description
ExoAnalytics is a React app that displays exoplanet data from [ASA's Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html). Data is presented in three main ways: firstly in charts, offering visualizations of trends and changes in data over time; secondly in statistics that show averages of planet properties such as mass; and thirdly, in individual planet profiles, allowing you to find and explore data for specific planets. The purpose of this project is to explore different methods of presenting large amounts of data in a Next.js React app.
